# Installation

## conda/pip




## Editable installation

If you want to be able to edit the files in `pyglider/pyglider` then install
as above, and then do `pip install -e .`.  That will re-install pyglider
with links to the local directory, so you can edit the library files.
If you do so consider making a pull-request with your changes!
